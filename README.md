# DHANASANKAR-K-VLSI---Verilog-Code-Project-
This repository contains Verilog HDL code for designing a [specific VLSI component or system, e.g., "16-bit ALU" or "4-stage pipeline CPU"]. It includes source files, testbenches, and simulation scripts for developing and validating digital circuits. Ideal for learning and experimenting with VLSI design principles.
